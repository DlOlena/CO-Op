# finalCapstoneWebDevHyperionDev
Hi and welcome to my final project at Web Development Bootcamp at HyperionDev
This is a base shell for an online eco store. 
So far it has several basic features - you can browse in only one section for now - "cleaning products"
but the idea is that every category is expandable and has a range of related products inside.
Once you enter the selected category you can like, review, or add the product to the basket.
All the products you add to the basket, as well as likes and reviews are pushed with JSON to local storage 
and rewritten dynamically with JS and HTML on the "basket" page.
So as soon as you click on the "buy" button - the one with the price on it, you can see the same object on the basket page
straight away.
The store can also save usersâ€™ messages and contact detail should they choose to leave them on the "Contact" page.
The data is pushed and stored at local storage with JSON as well.
